# Railway-Reservation-Management-System-in-Python-CLI-
This is a command-line interface (CLI) application written in Python for managing railway reservations, integrated with MySQL as the backend database. It allows users to sign up, sign in, view train details, check seat availability, book tickets, view and cancel bookings, and check PNR status.
Key features include:

User authentication (signup/signin)

Display and management of train details

Ticket booking and cancellation

PNR status checking

This project demonstrates Python programming with MySQL connectivity, file handling, and designing menu-driven applications for real-world railway reservation management.
